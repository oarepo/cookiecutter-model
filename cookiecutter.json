If you select this option, answer the next two questions\n                 (base_model_package, base_model_use) as well\n* empty_model  - just what it says, not recommended as you have no compatibility with\n                 the Czech National Repository\n\nWhen asked about the base_model_package: leave as is unless you have chosen a custom base model.\nIn that case enter the package name of the model builder extension on pypi which contains the custom model.\n\nWhen asked about the base_model_use: leave as is unless you have chosen a custom base model.\nIn that case enter the string that should be put to 'oarepo:use.
